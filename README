This is a simple XMPP mini-network generator for use while chatting about TV 
programmes. It's in its very early stages.

It runs with ejabberd.

The flow is something like this:

* Person goes to MidSoMu site, logs in using twitter and connects 
MidSoMu to a twitter account using oauth

* Once the twitter connection is made, strophe generates an anonymous 
jabber login, and sends a request to the collector to be its friend

* The 'collector' is a ruby programme that aggregates votes and sends 
them back to the other participants. It accepts friend requests and 
responds to chat queries (it has been previously registered with ejabberd)

* strophe connects from the client side, sends anonymous presence and a 
hello message to the collector

* The collector responds with a set of options and the current votes for 
them (the options are just hashes of name, image, votenumber)

* When the collector gets updates it updates and resends its presence 
(so any change in vote is told to everyone)

* An administrator page is identical except it allows you to add and 
remove voting options and hashtag

So the upshot is that a little ad-hoc network is generated specialised 
to the programme. All the config stuff is json and so it's very 
configurable.

What was interesting to me was that the voting (while quite fun on and 
off) wasn't as interesting as the adding of options. So I think there's 
a lot of potential there to make the 'admin' role much more general.

I consider this a piece of potentially useful infrastructure - I don't 
have the skills to make it pretty or think of the amazing uses it could 
be used for, but perhaps we together we can can make something?

Problems:

* The main problem now is that @anywhere twitter api output doesn't seem 
to show up in anything but Safari. Plus it's not clear when to update 
the timeline

* The collector doesn't currently save its state
